# Logs Metrics and Reports

This directory contains the files that have been used for the exploration of the compression algorithm that is to be implemented for the real time lossless compression of data from FASER DAQ runs. <p>
## Json Reports
This directory contains the JSON reports that are generated by the Compression Engine which records metrics like compression ratio etc. These are generated for each event that has been selected for processing. The JSON contains other relevant meta data as well
```json
{
    "TBD":"Insert sample JSON Report Format"
}
```
## Python based Automation and analysis
This would be the python scripts that are used to automate bulk runs for the compression engine to generate reports that can then be visualized and analyzed for deeper insights into the performance of each compressor. This could show patterns in compression ratio or compression spped of variuos algorithms; which can then help us choose the best one for implementation.
